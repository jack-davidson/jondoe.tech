<span class=fg1>J0ND03's Guide to Running old Hardware</span>
______________________________________

I use a Lenovo Thinkpad T60 from 2006 as my main laptop. Recently, I have
been asking fellow irc-dwellers and other forum-dwellers what hardware they are
using. I usually end up having the oldest hardware and I sometimes get questions,
"why *?".

<span class=fg1>Why do I use a laptop from 15 years ago?</span>

Back when IBM sold the Thinkpad brand to Lenovo, the transition created a couple
of amazing laptops like the Thinkpad X60 and T60. These were the first Lenovo
Thinkpad laptops and you could tell that these laptops were heavily designed by
IBM because later models had distinct design features that stated they were Lenovo,
not IBM. There was even an option to get IBM branding on the X60 and T60 (it was
pretty common for some reason, mine has IBM badges).

IBM had great quality, like how IBM's Model F and Model M keyboards still hold up
as the best keyboards ever and inspired the keyboard layout most people use today.
I use the old laptop because the Thinkpad T60 has a great balance between performance
(the T60 supports x86_64 processors and up to 3G of ram!) and still had the great
IBM design, utility, and form factor with its 4:3 aspect ratio.

In this guide, I hope to open you, the reader, to a whole new world of opportunites
to use older hardware that has certain quirks that spark your interest. You will
know what to do to create an optimized system that will work great on less powerful
hardware.


<span class=fg1>1. Rid your hardware of any Proprietary Operating System STAT!</span>

I assume that the readers of this blog all use free and open source *nix based
operating systems { */Linux, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, etc } but if you find old
hardware with say, Microsoft Windows installed on it, wipe that disk and install
your favorite *nix.


<span class=fg1>2. Operating System/Software Distribution choice</span>

When choosing an operating system to use on your old hardware, I would advise
an operating system that doesn't install much software by default. My current
operating system is Void Linux. Void Linux doesn't even require a compiler by
default so I took liberty in choosing <a href="https://bellard.org/tcc/">tcc</a>, aka. Tiny C Compiler which is way
less bloated that GCC or other popular compilers. I can also choose to install
any other software I need with a distribution like Void which doesn't install
much by default.


<span class=fg1>3. Software choice</span>

Now that you've chosen an operating system for your cool hardware, you have to
decide what software to install in your distribution. Install the bare minimum
packages needed for Xorg + Drivers and other software you may want but here comes
the fun part: WINDOW MANAGERS!!! I have been using suckless dwm for a few weeks
and I really love it! If you do not know, dwm's configuration is a C header file
called 'config.h'. All I needed to do was configure colors, keybindings (you will
need to know a little C bitwise logic for keybinds and configuring window rules),
and window rules. I modified config.mk to include my compiler, tcc by changing
'CC =' to 'CC = tcc'. Now run make, sudo make install and you are done!

Dwm is very efficient and when you study the source code, you can see that the people
at suckless really made an effort to utilize algorithms, bitwise logic (bitwise
logic saves a few cpu cycles when doing basic math), and data structures. Obviously,
one will install st, dmenu, and other suckless utilities until they are happy,
see <a href="https://suckless.org">here</a> for the suckless webpage. Suckless software expects that you know how
to install header files and dependencies, how to use make and compilers (obviously),
and how to figure out problems on your own as the source code is the real meaningful
documentation in suckless utilities. You also might want to know C or use the suckless
software as an opportunity to learn C because C is a great language especially when
dealing with *nix, pretty much everything is written in C and glued together with
POSIX shell.


<span class=fg1>4. Hardware Modifications</span>

With my T60, I had previously bought another one and I had a spare 64 bit cpu
with a beefier heatsink and I installed them in my T60 I have now. I proceded to
then install <a href="https://libreboot.org">libreboot</a>, a fully free and open source BIOS implementation based
off coreboot with the goal of eliminating proprietary BLOBS within the firmware.
This upgrade, theoretically, improved performance by something like 25% which is
pretty good.


<span class=fg1>Conclusion</span>

Old hardware is great and buying used hardware reduces waste and gives you cool
hardware with features that suite you. I love older hardware and I made this
article to guide more usage of old hardware and breathing new life into it with
minimalist software. My T60 runs 6 tabs of qutebrowser fine + 4 terminals and other
services running in the background. My ram usage, idle with no applications open
but with window manager running, is 77M. I may explore even older Thinkpads from
the early 2000's but for now, my laptop isn't about being the fastest or newest
from apple or dell, but its about being fully-free, customizable, and makes me
happy everytime I use it. I have the best laptop in the World and you can too!

<span class=fg1>Happy Hacking!</span>
