DEPRECATED, go to https://gitlab.com/J0ND03/portfolio for new site

This site is an old design, I would still like to keep it up on gitlab but
I don't think that I will have it hosted on the web because it is not very
appealing to people that don't use lynx or curl as their web browser.


/tech.jondoe

to get and preview website

    `git clone https://gitlab.com/J0ND03/tech.jondoe && cd tech.jondoe && $BROWSER index.html`
